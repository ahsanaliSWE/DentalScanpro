# **Dental Cavities Detection App (DentalScan Pro)**

## **Project Overview**

**DentalScan Pro** is an innovative mobile application designed to detect and analyze dental cavities using advanced deep learning algorithms. This project aims to aid dental professionals and individuals in identifying dental issues early, promoting better oral health care through a user-friendly platform.

The app integrates cutting-edge models like **MobileNet V2**, **ResNet 50**, **EfficientDet D1**, and **YOLOv8** for accurate detection. It also includes features for storing patient data, sharing results, and viewing detailed cavity analysis.

## **Key Results**

- **YOLOv8** achieved the highest detection accuracy and bounding box precision when implemented in the app.
- **ResNet 50** and **MobileNet V2** also performed well, but with slower detection times and occasional inaccuracies in bounding boxes.
- The app successfully integrates `.tflite` models for efficient mobile deployment.
